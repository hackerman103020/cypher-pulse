# 2x CC1101 Jammer Display ESP32

![Project Banner](img/banner.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a CC1101 device inspired by the works of the Evil Crow RF tool, featuring a dual CC1101 radio system with an ESP32 microcontroller. The original work by Adam Loboda has been expanded with a modern OLED display interface, button controls, and dual (future version will have 5 cc1011's for the ultimate researchers) radio capabilities by Cypher of Little Hakr.
## WORK IN PROGRESS EXPECT SOME BUGS :)

## Hardware Requirements

*Required components for the project*

- ESP32 development board
- Two CC1101 radio modules
- SSD1306 OLED display (128x64)
- Three push buttons
- LED indicator
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or custom PCB

## Pin Configuration
*Adjust to your needs!*

### CC1101 #1
- SCK: GPIO14
- MISO: GPIO12
- MOSI: GPIO13
- SS: GPIO15
- GDO0: GPIO26
- GDO2: GPIO27

### CC1101 #2
- SCK: GPIO18
- MISO: GPIO19
- MOSI: GPIO23
- SS: GPIO17
- GDO0: GPIO25
- GDO2: GPIO33

### Display & Controls
- OLED I2C: SDA=GPIO21, SCL=GPIO22
- Buttons: UP=GPIO5, DOWN=GPIO4, SELECT=GPIO32
- LED: Optional, not yet implemented, but choose extra pin

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   - ELECHOUSE_CC1101_SRC_DRV
     - https://github.com/LSatan/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib
   - ELECHOUSE_CC1101_SRC_DRV2 (MUST BE ADDED TO YOUR Adruino/libraries folder!)
     - This is a heavily custom version of the CC1101 library. It technically is not needed, 
     - but this allows you to duplicate more libraries and have 2-5+ cc1101's if required! You're welcome :)
   - Adafruit_GFX
   - Adafruit_SSD1306
   - U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX
   - EEPROM
   - EZbutton

3. Connect hardware according to pin configuration
4. Upload the sketch to your ESP32

## Usage

1. Power on the device
2. Navigate through the menu using UP/DOWN buttons
3. Select modes using the SELECT button
4. Monitor operations on the OLED display
5. Use serial monitor for additional control (115200 baud)

## Menu Options

- **2X CC JAM**: Activate both radios for jamming
- **CC#1 JAM**: Activate first radio only
- **CC#2 JAM**: Activate second radio only
- **SCAN**: Scan for RF signals (Edit code to change range, soon there will be a few ranges)
- **TEST_CC1101**: Test CC1101 radio connections
- **REC RAW**: Record raw RF data
- **PLAY RAW**: Playback recorded data
- **SHOW RAW**: Display recorded data
- **SHOW BUFF**: Show buffer contents
- **GET RSSI**: Display signal strength
- **FLUSH BUFF**: Clear recording buffer
- **STOP ALL**: Stop all operations
- **RESET CC**: Reset radio modules
- **Frequency Presets**: Quick frequency selection
